# Hungry GF Android App - Improvement Suggestions

## App Overview
"Hungry GF" is an Android app that helps users find food places based on their location. The app uses the Google Places API to search for restaurants, applies intelligent filtering based on opening hours and ratings, and presents a randomly selected option to help users decide where to eat.

## Current Features Analysis
- **Location Input**: Manual text input or GPS-based location detection
- **Google Places API Integration**: Searches for food establishments
- **Smart Filtering**: Filters places by opening hours and availability
- **Weighted Random Selection**: Uses ratings and price levels to suggest places
- **Material Design UI**: Clean, modern interface with custom styling

## ðŸš€ Major Improvements

### 1. **Architecture & Code Quality**

#### **Migrate to Modern Android Architecture**
- **Current Issue**: The app uses basic ViewModel without LiveData/StateFlow
- **Improvement**: Implement MVVM with Repository pattern using:
  - `StateFlow`/`SharedFlow` for reactive data streams
  - `Hilt` for dependency injection
  - `Room` database for local caching
  - `DataStore` instead of SharedPreferences

#### **Add Proper Error Handling**
- **Current Issue**: Limited error handling, hardcoded API key in repository
- **Improvements**:
  - Implement sealed classes for UI states (Loading, Success, Error)
  - Add network error handling with retry mechanisms
  - Implement graceful degradation when API fails
  - Add proper logging with `Timber`

#### **Code Structure Improvements**
```kotlin
// Suggested sealed class for UI states
sealed class UiState<out T> {
    object Loading : UiState<Nothing>()
    data class Success<T>(val data: T) : UiState<T>()
    data class Error(val exception: Throwable) : UiState<Nothing>()
}
```

### 2. **User Experience Enhancements**

#### **Enhanced Location Features**
- **Current**: Basic GPS location with city name lookup
- **Improvements**:
  - Add location permission rationale dialog
  - Implement location history/favorites
  - Add "Search nearby" radius selection
  - Show user's location on a map preview
  - Add location accuracy indicator

#### **Improved Search & Filtering**
- **Add Advanced Filters**:
  - Cuisine type selection (Italian, Chinese, Fast Food, etc.)
  - Price range slider
  - Distance radius selection
  - Dietary restrictions (Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-free)
  - Restaurant ratings threshold

#### **Better Results Presentation**
- **Current**: Shows only the selected restaurant name
- **Improvements**:
  - Show restaurant details (address, rating, price level, photos)
  - Add "Show Alternative" button for different suggestions
  - Display restaurant on map with directions
  - Show estimated travel time and distance
  - Add restaurant photos from Places API

### 3. **New Features to Add**

#### **Favorites & History System**
```kotlin
// Suggested data classes
@Entity(tableName = "favorite_places")
data class FavoritePlace(
    @PrimaryKey val placeId: String,
    val name: String,
    val address: String,
    val rating: Double,
    val priceLevel: String?,
    val addedDate: Long
)

@Entity(tableName = "search_history")
data class SearchHistory(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Long = 0,
    val location: String,
    val searchDate: Long,
    val resultPlaceName: String?
)
```
